# Newsletter Auto-Popup Implementation Guide

## Overview
Enhanced newsletter popup with smart auto-trigger functionality that appears every 3 days for non-subscribed users while respecting user experience and preferences.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Smart Auto-Trigger Logic**
- ✅ Popup appears automatically every 3 days for non-subscribed users
- ✅ Respects dismissals (won't show again for 3 days after dismissal)
- ✅ Never shows to subscribed users
- ✅ One popup per session (no repeated popups on page refreshes)
- ✅ localStorage-based tracking for persistence

### 2. **User Experience Optimizations**
- ✅ **Timing**: Random delay between 15-25 seconds after page load
- ✅ **Scroll-based trigger**: Popup can also trigger when user scrolls 50% of the page
- ✅ **Smart interruption prevention**: Won't show if user is typing or interacting with forms
- ✅ **Idle callback**: Uses `requestIdleCallback` to show during browser idle time
- ✅ **Smooth animations**: Framer Motion fade-in (scale 0.95→1, opacity 0→1, 0.4s duration)

### 3. **Tracking & Storage**
LocalStorage keys used:
- `mgh_popup_last_shown`: Timestamp of last popup display
- `mgh_popup_dismissed`: Timestamp when user closed popup
- `mgh_subscribed`: Boolean flag for subscription status

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **`src/hooks/useNewsletterAutoPopup.ts`**
   - Custom React hook managing all auto-popup logic
   - Handles timing, scroll tracking, and localStorage
   - Includes utility functions for debugging and testing

### Modified Files
1. **`src/components/modals/newsletter-modal.tsx`**
   - Added `onSubscribed` and `onDismissed` callbacks
   - Updated close handlers to track dismissals
   - Marks user as subscribed on successful subscription (including 409 already subscribed)

2. **`src/app/(main)/page.tsx`**
   - Integrated `useNewsletterAutoPopup` hook
   - Connected modal callbacks to tracking functions
   - Auto-popup triggers based on scroll depth and time

## Configuration

### Adjustable Constants (in `useNewsletterAutoPopup.ts`):
```typescript
const POPUP_INTERVAL_DAYS = 3        // Days between popups (default: 3)
const MIN_DELAY_MS = 15000           // Minimum wait time (15 seconds)
const RANDOM_DELAY_MS = 10000        // Random additional delay (±5 seconds)
const SCROLL_THRESHOLD = 0.5         // Scroll depth trigger (50%)
```

## Behavior Scenarios

### ✅ Scenario 1: First-Time Visitor
- User lands on homepage
- Wait 15-25 seconds OR scroll to 50% of page
- Popup appears with smooth animation
- `mgh_popup_last_shown` timestamp saved

### ✅ Scenario 2: User Dismisses Popup
- User closes popup (ESC, X button, or backdrop click)
- `mgh_popup_dismissed` timestamp saved
- Popup won't appear again for 3 days (72 hours)

### ✅ Scenario 3: User Subscribes
- User enters email and subscribes successfully
- `mgh_subscribed` set to `true`
- Popup never appears again (permanent)
- Works even if user was already subscribed (409 response)

### ✅ Scenario 4: Page Refresh (Same Day)
- User refreshes page within same session/day
- Popup does NOT reappear (session tracking)
- Only shows once per session

### ✅ Scenario 5: Return After 3+ Days
- Last shown/dismissed > 3 days ago
- User not subscribed
- Popup appears again automatically
- New timestamps saved

### ✅ Scenario 6: Manual Trigger Still Works
- User clicks "Subscribe to Newsletter" button in sidebar
- Popup opens immediately (bypasses auto-trigger logic)
- Works regardless of auto-popup status

### ✅ Scenario 7: User Is Typing
- Auto-trigger conditions met while user types in form
- Popup waits for idle state
- Retries after 5 seconds if still typing
- Uses `requestIdleCallback` for optimal timing

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Clear localStorage** to simulate first-time visitor:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('mgh_popup_last_shown')
   localStorage.removeItem('mgh_popup_dismissed')
   localStorage.removeItem('mgh_subscribed')
   ```

2. **Test first visit**:
   - Open homepage in incognito/private window
   - Wait 15-25 seconds or scroll to 50%
   - Popup should appear

3. **Test dismissal**:
   - Close popup with X button
   - Refresh page → Should NOT appear
   - Check localStorage: `mgh_popup_dismissed` should have timestamp

4. **Test subscription**:
   - Open popup manually via "Subscribe" button
   - Enter email and subscribe
   - Refresh page → Should NOT appear
   - Check localStorage: `mgh_subscribed` should be `'true'`

5. **Test 3-day interval**:
   ```javascript
   // Simulate 3 days ago
   const threeDaysAgo = Date.now() - (3 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 + 1000)
   localStorage.setItem('mgh_popup_last_shown', threeDaysAgo.toString())
   localStorage.removeItem('mgh_subscribed')
   // Refresh → popup should appear
   ```

6. **Test scroll trigger**:
   - Clear localStorage
   - Load page and immediately scroll to bottom
   - Popup should appear within ~20 seconds

7. **Test form interaction**:
   - Clear localStorage
   - Start typing in a form field
   - Wait 20+ seconds while typing
   - Popup should wait until idle

## Utility Functions

### For Testing/Debugging:
```typescript
import { 
  resetNewsletterPopupData, 
  getNewsletterPopupStatus 
} from '@/hooks/useNewsletterAutoPopup'

// Reset all data (for testing)
resetNewsletterPopupData()

// Check current status
const status = getNewsletterPopupStatus()
console.log(status)
/* Output:
{
  subscribed: false,
  lastShown: "2025-01-12T10:30:00.000Z",
  dismissed: null,
  timeSinceLastShown: 2, // hours
  timeSinceDismissed: null,
  nextEligibleTime: "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
*/
```

## Animation Details

### Entrance Animation:
```typescript
initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
transition={{ duration: 0.4 }}
```

### Exit Animation:
```typescript
exit={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }}
transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
```

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (full support including `requestIdleCallback`)
- ✅ Firefox (full support)
- ✅ Safari (fallback to `setTimeout` for `requestIdleCallback`)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (scroll depth and timing work correctly)

## Performance Considerations
- **Lightweight**: Hook adds < 2KB to bundle
- **Passive scrolling**: Scroll listener uses `{ passive: true }`
- **Idle callbacks**: Uses browser idle time when available
- **Session check**: Only runs logic once per session
- **No server calls**: All tracking done client-side with localStorage

## Privacy & Compliance
- No personal data stored (only timestamps and boolean flags)
- All data stays in user's browser (localStorage)
- User can clear data anytime via browser settings
- Respects user choice to dismiss or not subscribe

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Add A/B testing for timing and scroll thresholds
2. Track conversion rates (popup shown → subscribed)
3. Add custom triggers for specific pages
4. Implement exit-intent popup option
5. Add multi-language support for popup content

## Troubleshooting

### Popup not appearing?
1. Check localStorage values with `getNewsletterPopupStatus()`
2. Verify not already subscribed: `mgh_subscribed !== 'true'`
3. Check last shown timestamp is > 3 days ago
4. Try clearing localStorage and testing in incognito

### Popup appearing too often?
1. Verify `POPUP_INTERVAL_DAYS` is set correctly (default: 3)
2. Check that dismissal timestamps are being saved
3. Ensure session tracking is working (`hasShownThisSession`)

### Animation not smooth?
1. Check Framer Motion is installed
2. Verify no CSS conflicts with modal styles
3. Test in different browsers

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful** - All TypeScript checks passed
✅ **No Linter Errors** - Code follows best practices
✅ **No Hydration Warnings** - SSR-safe implementation
✅ **Bundle Size Impact**: Minimal (~2KB)
